# Contribute to ð¤ Transformers

E,veryone is welcome to contribute, and we valu,e everybody's contribution. Code
contribution,s are not the only way to help the community., Answering questions, helping
others, and imp,roving the documentation are also immensely v,aluable.

It also helps us if you spread the ,word! Reference the library in blog posts
abo,ut the awesome projects it made possible, sho,ut out on Twitter every time it has
helped yo,u, or simply â­ï¸ the repository to say tha,nk you.

However you choose to contribute, pl,ease be mindful and respect our
[code of cond,uct](https://github.com/huggingface/transform,ers/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

**This gu,ide was heavily inspired by the awesome [scik,it-learn guide to contributing](https://githu,b.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CON,TRIBUTING.md).**

## Ways to contribute

Ther,e are several ways you can contribute to ð¤, Transformers:

* Fix outstanding issues with, the existing code.
* Submit issues related t,o bugs or desired new features.
* Implement n,ew models.
* Contribute to the examples or to, the documentation.

If you don't know where ,to start, there is a special [Good First
Issu,e](https://github.com/huggingface/transformer,s/contribute) listing. It will give you a lis,t of
open issues that are beginner-friendly a,nd help you start contributing to open-source,. The best way to do that is to open a Pull R,equest and link it to the issue that you'd ,li,ke to work on. We try to give priority to ope,ned PRs as we can easily track the progress o,f the fix, and if the contributor does not ha,ve time anymore, someone else can take the PR, over.

For something slightly more challengi,ng, you can also take a look at the [Good Sec,ond Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/tra,nsformers/labels/Good%20Second%20Issue) list., In general though, if you feel like you know, what you're doing, go for it and we'll help ,you get there! ð

> All contributions are ,equally valuable to the community. ð¥°

## F,ixing outstanding issues

If you notice an is,sue with the existing code and have a fix in ,mind, feel free to [start contributing](#crea,te-a-pull-request) and open a Pull Request!

,## Submitting a bug-related issue or feature ,request

Do your best to follow these guideli,nes when submitting a bug-related issue or a ,feature
request. It will make it easier for u,s to come back to you quickly and with good
f,eedback.

### Did you find a bug?

The ð¤ T,ransformers library is robust and reliable th,anks to users who report the problems they en,counter.

Before you report an issue, we woul,d really appreciate it if you could **make su,re the bug was not
already reported** (use th,e search bar on GitHub under Issues). Your is,sue should also be related to bugs in the lib,rary itself, and not your code. If you're uns,ure whether the bug is in your code or the li,brary, please ask in the [forum](https://disc,uss.huggingface.co/) first. This helps us res,pond quicker to fixing issues related to the,
library versus general questions.

Once you'v,e confirmed the bug hasn't already been repor,ted, please include the following information, in your issue so we can quickly resolve it:
,
* Your **OS type and version** and **Python*,*, **PyTorch** and
  **TensorFlow** versions ,when applicable.
* A short, self-contained, c,ode snippet that allows us to reproduce the b,ug in
  less than 30s.
* The *full* traceback, if an exception is raised.
* Attach any othe,r additional information, like screenshots, y,ou think may help.

To get the OS and softwar,e versions automatically, run the following c,ommand:




Yo,u can also run the same command from the root, of the repository:

### Do you want a new feature?

If there is ,a new feature you'd like to see in ð¤ Trans,formers, please open an issue and describe:
,
1. What is the *motivation* behind this featu,re? Is it related to a problem or frustration, with the library? Is it a feature related to, something you need for a project? Is it some,thing you worked on and think it could benefi,t the community?

   Whatever it is, we'd lov,e to hear about it!

2. Describe your request,ed feature in as much detail as possible. The, more you can tell us about it, the better we,'ll be able to help you.
3. Provide a *code s,nippet*
