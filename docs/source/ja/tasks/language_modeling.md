PyTorch code for causal language modeling using the DistilGPT2 model. The code includes loading the ELI5 dataset, preprocessing the dataset, grouping the texts together for the model, preparing the dataset for the model, and training the model. The model is then evaluated and pushed to the Hugging Face model hub.
