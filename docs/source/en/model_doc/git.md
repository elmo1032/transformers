# GIT

## Overview

The GIT model was proposed in [GIT: A Generative Image-to-text Transformer for Vision and Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14100) by Jianfeng Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Xiaowei Hu, Linjie Li, Kevin Lin, Zhe Gan, Zicheng Liu, Ce Liu, Lijuan Wang. GIT is a decoder-only Transformer that leverages [CLIP](clip)'s vision encoder to condition the model on vision inputs besides text. The model obtains state-of-the-art results on image captioning and visual question answering benchmarks.
